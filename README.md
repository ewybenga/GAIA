Growing Automatically Is Awesome :D

This will be the central repository holding all of the code produced for my project descibed in [my blog](https://ericwybenga.com/home/blog/).

## Arduino
The code in this folder was made to be uploaded to an Arduino board. It was developed on the ELEGOO UNO R3 from [this kit](https://www.elegoo.com/collections/arduino-learning-sets/products/elegoo-uno-most-complete-starter-kit). To upload, copy the file ending in `.ino` into the Arduino IDE window, verify that the code compiles, and hit the "Upload" button.
